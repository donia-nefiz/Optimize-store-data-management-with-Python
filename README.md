# Optimize store data management with Python
My mission here for BottleNeck was to optimize their database management by manually reconciling their ERP and Web data sources. 
I was also asked to calculate their online sales based on the final result and realize an univariate analysis of their online product prices.
<br></br>

<b> Summary</b> :
<br></br>
 I. Explore and clean <a href="https://github.com/donia-nefiz/Optimize-store-data-management-with-Python" target="_blank">BottleNeck datas</a>

<br>*2. [web.csv](http://localhost:8888/edit/web.csv) : exploration and data cleaning*</br>
<br>*3. [liaison.csv](http://localhost:8888/edit/liaison.csv) : exploration and data cleaning*</br>
<br>*4. New df (merge) and outliers management*
<br>*-- a. First merge : df_liaison_web*</br>
<br>*-- b. Second merge : df_liaison_erp*</br>
<br>*-- c. Final merge : df_web_erp*</br>
<br></br>
II. Calculation and univariate analysis
<br></br>
    <br>1. Sales revenue</br>
    <br>*-- a. Sales per products*</br>
    <br>*-- b. Total sales*</br>
    <br>2. Univariate analysis</br>
